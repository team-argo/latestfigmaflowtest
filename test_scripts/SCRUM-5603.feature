## Gherkin Test Script

**Feature: Home Page - Healthcare Services Section**

As a website visitor,
I want to easily find and access key healthcare services and information
So that I can quickly schedule appointments or locate facilities.

---

### Scenario 1: Visibility and Basic Structure Validation

This scenario ensures the required section is present, titled correctly, and visually distinct.

**Given** I am a standard unauthenticated user
**When** I navigate to the Home Page URL
**Then** I should see a dedicated section labeled "Healthcare Services" or similar ("Find Care," "Our Services")
**And** The section should be displayed in a prominent location (e.g., above the fold or immediately below the hero banner)
**And** The section should contain a brief introductory statement about the services offered
**And** All images and icons displayed within the section should load successfully

---

### Scenario 2: Quick Action Links Functionality (Calls to Action)

This scenario uses a Scenario Outline to efficiently test the core functional links expected within a services section.

**Scenario Outline: Validation of Critical Healthcare CTAs**

**Given** I am viewing the "Healthcare Services" section on the Home Page
**When** I click on the "<Action Link>" call-to-action button
**Then** I should be redirected to the corresponding "<Expected URL Slug>"
**And** The destination page should display the title "<Expected Page Title>"

| Action Link | Expected URL Slug | Expected Page Title |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Schedule an Appointment | /schedule | Schedule Appointment |
| Find a Doctor | /doctors/search | Find a Doctor |
| Find a Location | /locations | Hospital Locations |
| Pay a Bill Online | /billing/pay | Online Bill Pay |

### Scenario 3: Dynamic Service Content Display

If the service section displays dynamically loaded content (e.g., featured specialties or seasonal health tips), this scenario validates its integrity.

**Given** I have successfully loaded the Home Page
**When** I view the service listing area within the "Healthcare Services" section
**Then** I should see at least 3 distinct service or specialty cards loaded (e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics, Urgent Care)
**And** Each service card should contain a title, a brief description, and a functional "Learn More" link
**And** The data displayed should be current as of today's date
**But** The number of service cards displayed should not exceed 6 (to maintain visual clarity)

---

### Scenario 4: Search Bar Integration (If Applicable)

If the Healthcare Services section includes an integrated search functionality (common for doctor/service lookups), this scenario tests its basic function.

**Given** I am viewing the "Healthcare Services" section
**And** The dedicated service search bar is visible
**When** I enter valid search criteria, such as "Pediatrics"
**And** I click the "Search" button
**Then** I should be redirected to the dedicated search results page
**And** The results page should display results relevant to "Pediatrics"
**But** If I enter invalid or empty criteria, a validation message should appear before redirection

---

### Scenario 5: Accessibility and Responsive Design Check

This scenario ensures the section remains usable and accessible across different devices.

**Given** I have navigated to the Home Page
**When** I resize the viewport to a common mobile resolution (e.g., 375px width)
**Then** The content of the "Healthcare Services" section should reflow and stack appropriately
**And** All Call-to-Action buttons should maintain a minimum touch target size (e.g., 44px by 44px)
**And** All textual elements (headings, descriptions) should remain legible and follow contrast accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
